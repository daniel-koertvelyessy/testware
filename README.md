DB_DATABASE=[laravel]
DB_USERNAME=[root]
DB_PASSWORD=[passworrd]
```

Within your project folder run the migration of the database.

```php
php artisan migrate
```

> If you want to use our sample data you can add a `--seed` flag. This will add some random locations, equipment and requirements

### Step 3: setup e-mail connection (optional)

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=[smpt.provider-address.com]
MAIL_PORT=[587]
MAIL_USERNAME=[username]
MAIL_PASSWORD=[password]
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=[yourmail@address.com]
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

**Note:**
If you do not want to use the e-mail features change the key `MAIL_MAILER=smtp` to `MAIL_MAILER=log` and leave the other keys blank.
